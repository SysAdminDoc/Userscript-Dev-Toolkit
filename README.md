## Introduction

In the world of web development and customization, userscript authors often find themselves in a constant loop of inspecting elements, debugging scripts, and writing ad-hoc CSS, all while juggling browser developer tools that are not always tailored for the unique challenges of script injection. The **Userscript Dev Toolkit** was born out of this necessity. In short, I found myself doing things over and over and over again, realized this could be made into a simple tool.

This toolkit is a powerful, self-contained, in-page control panel that runs on any website. It consolidates the most common development tasks into a single, elegant, and highly configurable interface. Forget wrestling with the console; this toolkit provides specialized tools designed to streamline your workflow, from generating complex ad-blocker rules to capturing elusive hover-state styles with a delayed debugger. It's the co-pilot every serious userscript developer deserves.

## Features

The toolkit is organized into logical tabs, each providing a distinct set of functionalities.

---

#### 1. Inspector (üîç)
* **What it does:** Allows you to select any element on the page with a simple click. Upon selection, it provides the element's tag name, ID, classes, a precise CSS selector path, and its full `outerHTML`.
* **How it improves the interface:** It eliminates the need to dig through the browser's "Elements" panel to find a reliable selector for an element you wish to target. It provides clean, copy-paste-ready selectors instantly.
* **Example Usage:**
    1.  Click the "Pick Element" button.
    2.  Hover over the page; elements will be highlighted.
    3.  Click on the desired element.
    4.  The Inspector tab will populate with the element's details, ready for you to copy the CSS Path or OuterHTML.

    ```
    <!-- Sample Output -->
    Tag: <div> | ID: #main-content | Class: .container.flex
    CSS Path: body > div#app > main > div#main-content
    OuterHTML: <div id="main-content" class="container flex">...</div>
    ```

---

#### 2. uBlock Filter Generator (üõ°Ô∏è)
* **What it does:** Automatically generates a list of robust, ready-to-use cosmetic filter rules for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) based on a selected element.
* **How it improves the interface:** It dramatically accelerates the process of creating ad-blocker filters. Instead of manually crafting rules, it provides multiple strategic options (by ID, class, text content, attributes) to ensure the element is blocked effectively and reliably.
* **Example Usage:**
    1.  In the uBlock tab, click "Pick Element".
    2.  Select an annoying ad banner on the page.
    3.  The toolkit will instantly generate several filter rules. Click the copy icon next to the most suitable one and paste it into your uBlock Origin "My Filters" list.

    ```
    # Generated Filters for a div with id="promo-banner"
    example.com##div#promo-banner
    example.com##div.promo.advert
    example.com##div:has-text(/Limited Time Offer/)
    ```

---

#### 3. CSS Viewer (üé®)
* **What it does:** Fetches and aggregates all CSS from every stylesheet (`<link>` and `<style>`) loaded on the current page. It includes an option to automatically clean the output by removing comments and empty rules.
* **How it improves the interface:** It provides a centralized view of the page's entire styling architecture. This is invaluable for understanding how a site is built, finding specific style rules to override, or grabbing a clean copy of a site's CSS for local experimentation.
* **Example Usage:**
    1.  Click the "Fetch All Styles" button.
    2.  Toggle the "Remove junk/empty styles" switch to get a minified, readable version.
    3.  Click "Download .css" to save the entire stylesheet collection to a local file.

---

#### 4. CSS Tools (üõ†Ô∏è)
* **What it does:** Features an advanced, high-precision color picker that utilizes the browser's native `EyeDropper` API.
* **How it improves the interface:** It allows you to pick *any* color from anywhere on your screen, not just from within the webpage. The native browser interface provides a zoomed-in loupe for pixel-perfect accuracy, far surpassing traditional element-based color pickers.
* **Example Usage:**
    1.  Click "Pick Screen Color".
    2.  The browser's eyedropper interface activates.
    3.  Use the loupe to select the exact color you need, even from a background image or a browser UI element.
    4.  The selected color's HEX code appears in the toolkit, ready to be copied.

---

#### 5. JavaScript Debugger (üêõ)
* **What it does:** Triggers a `debugger;` statement with a configurable time delay (0, 3, 6, or 9 seconds).
* **How it improves the interface:** This is a game-changer for debugging dynamic UIs. You can trigger the pause, then use the delay to perform an action like hovering over a menu to reveal a dropdown. The script execution will then pause, freezing the temporary element in place so you can inspect its properties and styles in the DevTools.
* **Example Usage:**
    1.  Set the delay to "3 Seconds".
    2.  Click "Trigger Pause".
    3.  Quickly move your mouse to hover over a navigation menu that has a CSS-based `:hover` dropdown.
    4.  After 3 seconds, the script will pause, and the dropdown will remain visible in the DevTools for inspection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
You must have a userscript manager browser extension installed. Recommended options include:
* [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
* [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox)
* [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Step-by-step instructions
1.  **Click to Install:** Click the following link to navigate to the script source:
    * [**Install Userscript Dev Toolkit**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SysAdminDoc/Userscript-Dev-Toolkit/main/dist/Userscript-Dev-Toolkit.user.js)
2.  **Confirm Installation:** Your userscript manager will automatically detect the script and prompt you to confirm the installation.
3.  **Done!** The script is now installed and will run on all websites.

## Usage

Once installed, the Userscript Dev Toolkit will automatically appear on every webpage.

* **Activation:** The toolkit panel is visible by default. You can hide and show it by clicking the `‚ùå` button or by using the toggle command in your userscript manager's menu.
* **Interface:**
    * **Draggable & Resizable:** Click and drag the header to move the panel. Drag the bottom-right corner to resize it.
    * **Tabs:** Click any tab at the top to switch between tools.
    * **Header Buttons:** Use the header icons to collapse the panel to the side of the screen, resize it, access settings, or hide it completely.

## Configuration

The toolkit is highly configurable via the **Settings (‚öôÔ∏è)** menu. All preferences are automatically saved and restored on your next visit.

* **Appearance:**
    * **Theme:** Choose between White, Dark, Darker, and Glass (with acrylic blur effect).
    * **Compact Mode:** Reduces padding for a more condensed view.
* **Functionality:**
    * **Enable Collapse Arrows:** Show or hide the `‚¨ÖÔ∏è` and `‚û°Ô∏è` buttons in the header.
    * **Sync with DevTools:** Automatically show/hide the toolkit when you open/close the browser's F12 developer tools.
* **Visible Tabs:** Don't need a specific tool? Hide any tab from the main interface to declutter your workspace.

### Core modules and their responsibilities
The script is built with a modular, class-based architecture for maintainability and extensibility.
* `DevToolkit`: The main application class. It orchestrates the entire lifecycle, manages the UI, state, and communication between components.
* `ToolkitComponent`: A base class that all functional tabs (Inspector, uBlock, etc.) extend from. It provides a standardized structure for rendering and event binding.
* `SettingsManager`: A dedicated class for managing persistence. It handles loading and saving all user preferences to `GM_storage`, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions.

## API / Function Reference

While most of the script is self-contained, its core helper functions are robust and can be referenced for understanding the script's internals.

| `qsa(selector, parent)` | `selector` (String), `parent` (Element, optional) | `NodeList` | A shorthand for `document.querySelectorAll`, scoped to a parent if provided. |
| `createElement(...)` | `tag` (String), `classes` (Array), `attributes` (Object), `text` (String) | `Element` | A factory function for creating and configuring DOM elements. |
| `rgbToHex(rgb)` | `rgb` (String) | `String` | Converts an `rgb(r, g, b)` color string to its `#RRGGBB` hex equivalent. |
| `getCssPath(el)` | `el` (Element) | `String` | Generates a unique and stable CSS selector path for a given DOM element. |
